## Music Genre Classification using Deep Learning
A comprehensive deep learning project for classifying music genres using audio features and neural networks. 
## Project Overview
This project implements a music genre classification system using deep learning techniques. It processes audio files, extracts relevant features, and trains neural networks to classify music into different genres.

## Key Features

Audio Feature Extraction: MFCC, spectral features, chroma, and zero-crossing rate

CNN Architecture: Convolutional neural network for spectrogram processing

Comprehensive Evaluation: Detailed performance analysis and visualization

Model Persistence: Save and load trained models for deployment

Real-time Prediction: Function for classifying new audio files

##  Supported Genres

The model is trained to classify 10 music genres:

Blues

Classical

Country

Disco

Hip-hop

Jazz

Metal

Pop

Reggae

Rock
